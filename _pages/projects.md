## <span style="color:maroon;"> Cell Shape and Defect Detection in AFM Microscopic Images </span> 
* Created an LLM-powered user interface using **LangChain**, **LangGraph** and **Streamlit** to guide users in identifying and resolving defects in AFM images.
* Analyzed zero-shot performance of **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, including **GPT-4o, Gemini, and LLaVA**, for cell shape classification.
* Leveraged **transfer learning** to enhance **YOLOv3**-based **object detection** for cell shape detection in AFM images, achieving a **43%** accuracy improvement.
* Achieved up to **60×** speed improvement in AFM scanning probe traversal using intelligent vision-based navigation over manual navigation.
