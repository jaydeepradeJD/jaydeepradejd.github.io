## AI-AFM Assisted Structure Prediction of Protein Complexes
* Developing novel view synthesis methods for 3D NeRF reconstruction of protein structure using diffusion models.
* Created Virtual AFM:gpu-accelerated computer graphics program and accelerated data generation using GNU Parallel.
* Compiled an large dataset featuring multi-view virtual AFM images for over 550,000 voxelized 3D protein structures.

## Deep Learning for High-resolution 3D Structural Topology Optimization
* Designed PSP-U-Net architecture in Keras for performing STO.
* Leveraged multigrid-style training to train up to high-resolution of 128 × 128 × 128 3D structures.
* Achieved 5× speed up using distributed training across multiple GPUs.

## Deep Learning for Structural Topology Optimization
* Designed multiple neural networks model to perform end-to-end topology optimization consistent with SIMP algorithm using 3D CNNs.
* Built and accelerated the dataset generation pipeline using GNU parallel shell and created a dataset of 60K high-resolution of 128 × 128 × 128 3D voxelized structures.
