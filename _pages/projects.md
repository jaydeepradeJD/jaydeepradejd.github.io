## AI-AFM Assisted Structure Prediction of Protein Complexes
* Developed the Virtual AFM using gpu-accelerated computer graphics program and used GNU parallel to speed up the data generation.
* Created a dataset of the virtual AFM like multi-view images for 550K voxelized 3D structure of proteins
* Working on protein folding problem to predict the 3D structure of a protein complexes.
* Exploring 3D reconstruction neural network algorithm from multi-view AFM images.

## Cell Shape Detection in AFM Microscopic Images
* Implemented YOLO object detection algorithm using PyTorch for cell shape detection in AFM images.
* Incorporated intelligent vision-based navigation for traversing the AFM scanning probe.

## Deep Learning for Topology Optimization
* Designed multiple neural networks model to perform end-to-end topology optimization consistent with SIMP algorithm using 3D CNNs.
* Built the pipeline using GNU parallel shell tool to parallelize 3D dataset generation and voxelization.
