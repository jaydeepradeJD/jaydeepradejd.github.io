I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Electrical Engineering department at Iowa State University (ISU), under the guidance of [Dr. Adarsh Krishnamurthy](https://web.me.iastate.edu/idealab/p-krishnamurthy.html){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Anwesha Sarkar](https://sites.google.com/iastate.edu/bacm-lab/team-and-contact?authuser=0){:target="_blank"}.  My PhD work primarily focuses on developing deep learning models for generating high-resolution 3D structures across various engineering domains, including structural engineering and computational biology. My current project involves the 3D reconstruction of protein structures from AFM images, leveraging diffusion models and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs).

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I obtained M.S. in 2021 from Iowa State University, with my thesis titled "Deep Learning Frameworks for Structural Topology Optimization"[link](https://doi.org/10.31274/etd-20210609-153){:target="_blank"}, supervised by [Dr. Adarsh Krishnamurthy](https://web.me.iastate.edu/idealab/p-krishnamurthy.html){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Soumik Sarkar](https://sites.google.com/view/scslab-isu/team-contact?authuser=2){:target="_blank"}. In 2018, I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology(B.Tech.) in Electronics Engineering from the Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI) in Mumbai, India.

My research interests includes applied deep learning, computer vision, generative models, with a particular focus on the high-resolution 3D reconstruction and generation for engineering applications. 
Apart from academics, I have gained industry experience through internships at Bayer Crop Science, where I worked as a Computer Vision Intern, and at ANSYS, where I was a Machine Learning Intern.

Apart from research, I enjoy playing FPS games like CS or Valorant. In my free time I usually watch movies, TV shows (recently hooked to crime documentatries). In pleasant weather I go for long drives to explore the water bodies. My go to stress buster is cooking and hanging out with friends.
